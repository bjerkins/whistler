## Slack Message Customization

To customize the Slack message to your needs, you should mount `message.json` to `/app/message.json`
inside the container. This service uses a standard [Slack attachment
message](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) where the following template variables are
available:

| Variable           | Label   | Description                                                           |
| -------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `${version}`       | No      | The upgraded version of the service.                                  |
| `${previous}`      | No      | The previous version of the upgraded service                          |
| `${friendlyName}`  | Yes     | Friendly name of the service                                          |
| `${githubUrl}`     | Yes     | Github URL of the service. Will be used to point to the release notes.|
