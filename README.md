## Slack Message Customization

To customize the Slack message to your needs, you should mount `message.json` to `/app/message.json`
inside the container. This service uses a standard [Slack attachment
message](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) where the following template variables are
available:

| Variable           | Label   | Description                                                           |
| -------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `${version}`       | No      | The upgraded version of the service.                                  |
| `${previous}`      | No      | The previous version of the upgraded service                          |
| `${friendlyName}`  | Yes     | Friendly name of the service                                          |
| `${githubUrl}`     | Yes     | Github URL of the service. Will be used to point to the release notes.|

### Example message

Example of `message.json`:
```json
{
    "channel": "#some-slack-channel",
    "attachments": [{
        "fallback": "${friendlyName}:${version} has been released!",
        "color": "#bada55",
        "pretext": "Pop the cork :champagne: My awesome service just got a little better with a new release :rocket:",
        "title": "${friendlyName} (release notes)",
        "title_link": "${githubUrl}/releases/tag/${version}",
        "fields": [
            {

                "value": "${version}",
                "short": false
            },
            {
                "title": "Previous",
                "value": "${previous}",
